description: "The tmQM-xtb dataset performs GFN2-xTB-based MD simulations starting from the energy-minimized geometries 
    in the tmQM dataset.  

    The original tmQM dataset contains the geometries and properties of mononuclear complexes extracted from the
    Cambridge Structural Database, including Werner, bioinorganic, and organometallic complexes based on a large
    variety of organic ligands and 30 transition metals (the 3d, 4d, and 5d from groups 3 to 12).
    All complexes are closed-shell, with a formal charge in the range {+1, 0, −1}e .

  about: "This dataset contains 23175b unique systems with 230,030 total configurations (maximum of 10 per system), 
          sampled at T=200K. While 30 configurations were generated per system during sampling, this dataset limits 
          this to be a maximum of 10 configurations per system, to allow for more direct comparison with T=100K data.
          

          This dataset is limited to systems that contain transition metals Pd, Zn, Fe, or Cu, 
          and also only contain elements C, H, P, S, O, N, F, Cl, or Br.
          
          Potentially problematic configurations (i.e., unstable or those with structural changes) were removed. 
          Briefly, bond inference was performed on the initial configuration using RDKit and a configuration was 
          excluded if any of those bond distances changed by more than 0.15 angstroms compared to the initial, 
          energy minimized state.

          This dataset was generated starting from the tmQM dataset; the original tmQM repository 
          (https://github.com/uiocompcat/tmQM) was forked and a release made that corresponds to the data committed
          on 13 August 2024 (https://github.com/chrisiacovella/tmQM/releases/tag/2024Aug13).

          Each system in the tmQM database was evaluated using gfn2-xtb, and then a short MD simulation performed to 
          provide additional configurations of the systems.

          - The tblite package was used to evaluate the energetic of the system using the gfn2-xtb formalism.
          - MD simulations were performed using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), using the Langevin integrator.
          - Simulations were performed at 200K with a 1 fs timestep and 0.01 1/fs friction damping factor. 
          - In all trajectories, the first configuration corresponds to the energy minimized configuration reported 
            in the original tmQM dataset.
          - 100 steps were taken between snapshots (100 fs), with 30 total snapshots per system.
          - During MD sampling, gfn2-xtb accuracy was set to 2; all reported properties were calculated at 
            gfn2-xtb accuracy level 1.
